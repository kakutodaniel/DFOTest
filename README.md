# DFOTest

This solution was built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3 and .NET Core version 3.1.

## Development server

If you are using Docker, you can run the command `docker-compose up -d` at the root of the project. If things go well, the API will serve in `http://localhost:3000` and Web application in `http://localhost:4200`. You will not need do anything else. It will take about 8 minutes.

For API debugging mode, you open `DKakuto.DFO.Test.sln` in `Visual Studio` and run the application `(F5)` (the API should be running on port 3000).

For Web debugging mode, you open `DFO-Test-Web` folder in `Visual Studio Code`, open a terminal and run the command `ng serve --open` (the Web application should be running on port 4200).

Happy tests!
